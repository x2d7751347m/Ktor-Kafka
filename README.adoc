. Login via /login path to acquire `Authorization` key
. Set `Authorization` key to `Authorization` header
... Don't forget the prefix `Bearer `
... e.g) `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIU....`
. Now you can access every apis!

=== Notice
... You don't need to create a user when connecting to `/messages/{group}`.
... If you connected with `Authorization` header, the server shows your nickname.

.../admins/... paths can only be accessed by admins(set your role to `ADMIN`.)
